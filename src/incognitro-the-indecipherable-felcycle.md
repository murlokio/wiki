# Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle

The **Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle**, is a striking green motorbike introduced in World of Warcraft during its 20th anniversary event. This ground mount channels the unmistakable energy of the Burning Legion, offering players a unique vehicle with a Fel-infused aesthetic. 

Obtaining the Incognitro is no small feat, as it involves a lengthy questline packed with **Secrets of Azeroth** puzzles to solve. Essential tools like the **Torch of Pyrreth**, **Tricked-Out Thinking Cap**, and **Idol of Ohn'ahra** are key to progressing through this challenging yet rewarding journey.
