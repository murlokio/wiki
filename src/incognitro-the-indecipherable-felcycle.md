# Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle

The **Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle**, is a striking green motorbike introduced in World of Warcraft during its 20th anniversary event. This ground mount channels the unmistakable energy of the Burning Legion, offering players a unique vehicle with a Fel-infused aesthetic.

Obtaining the Incognitro is no small feat, as it involves a lengthy questline packed with **Secrets of Azeroth** puzzles to solve. Essential tools like the **Torch of Pyrreth**, **Tricked-Out Thinking Cap**, and **Idol of Ohn'ahra** are key to progressing through this challenging yet rewarding journey.

This peculiar key is incomplete and requires a gem to socket into it before it can be used. Finding this gem is your next task.

### How to Begin Ratts' Race Quest

Equip the **Detective** title and travel to **Dornogal**, where you’ll find a **Dalaran Survivor** near the hot spring in the northeast part of the city. Speak to the survivor, and they will offer the **Ratts' Race** quest if the title is active.
