# Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle

The **Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle**, is a striking green motorbike introduced in World of Warcraft during its 20th anniversary event. This ground mount channels the unmistakable energy of the Burning Legion, offering players a unique vehicle with a Fel-infused aesthetic.

Obtaining the Incognitro is no small feat, as it involves a lengthy questline packed with **Secrets of Azeroth** puzzles to solve. Essential tools like the **Torch of Pyrreth**, **Tricked-Out Thinking Cap**, and **Idol of Ohn'ahra** are key to progressing through this challenging yet rewarding journey.

## Prerequisite: Greatest Detective Title

To begin your journey toward acquiring the **Incognitro, the Indecipherable Felcycle**, you must first earn the **Detective** title. This title is awarded upon completing the **Azeroth's Greatest Detective** achievement.

### How to Obtain the Greatest Detective Title

Complete all quests given by Alyx and solve the Darkmoon card puzzle.
Alyx is located on the central platform of the World of Warcraft 20th anniversary event. Completing all her quests and dialogue will unlock the **Azeroth's Greatest Detective** achievement and reward the Detective title.

## Inert Peculiar Key

The first step in your journey is to locate the **Inert Peculiar Key**, a mysterious item hidden in **Marshal's Refuge**. It can be found tucked inside the trunk of a dead tree.

### How to Find the Inert Peculiar Key

Travel to **Marshal's Refuge** in Un'Goro Crater and search for a hollow dead tree. The **Inert Peculiar Key** is located inside.

This peculiar key is incomplete and requires a gem to socket into it before it can be used. Finding this gem is your next task.

## Ratts' Race

With the **Detective** title equipped, your next step is to take on the quest **Ratts' Race**. This quest will ultimately reward you with the **Peculiar Gem**, which is needed to complete the **Inert Peculiar Key**.

### How to Begin Ratts' Race Quest

Equip the **Detective** title and travel to **Dornogal**, where you’ll find a **Dalaran Survivor** near the hot spring in the northeast part of the city. Speak to the survivor, and they will offer the **Ratts' Race** quest if the title is active.

Confront Ratts, and she will drop the **Peculiar Gem**, completing this step.

## Karazhan Catacombs

With the **Peculiar Gem** in hand, the next step is to unlock the secrets of the **Karazhan Catacombs**. Begin by socketing the **Peculiar Gem** into the **Inert Peculiar Key**, transforming it and preparing it for use in the next stage of your journey.

Travel to **Karazhan** in **Deadwind Pass** and locate the entrance to the catacombs. This hidden location is the gateway to the next challenge. Use the **Torch of Pyrreth** to reveal the entrance to the instance.

Your next objective is to activate all twelve of them to continue your quest.

## 1 O'Clock Pylon: Love

To activate the 1 o’clock pylon, you must acquire three stacks of the **The Light of Their Love** buff. These stacks are earned by using the **Torch of Pyrreth** at three locations connected to the story of an Orc named **Olgra**.

### Humble Monument

The first location is the **Humble Monument** in the **Northern Barrens**. Use the **Torch of Pyrreth** near the monument to gain the first stack of the buff.

### Decimator Olgra

The third and final location is in **Maldraxxus** within the **Shadowlands**, where **Decimator Olgra**, an afterlife version of the character, resides. Use the **Torch of Pyrreth** near her to obtain the third stack of the buff.
