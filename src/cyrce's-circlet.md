# Cyrce's Circlet

**Cyrce’s Circlet** is a powerful new ring introduced in **World of Warcraft’s The War Within 11.0.7 patch**. Rewarded for completing the **Siren Isle questline**, this ring starts at item level 639 and is upgradable to 657. Featuring three special sockets for **Citrine Gems**, Cyrce’s Circlet offers versatile customization options for both PvE and PvP players.

## Where to Find Cyrce’s Circlet in WoW

Cyrce’s Circlet is a reward from the main **Siren Isle** quest line, which begins with the quest **"The Expedition Awaits"** given by **Dawn**, located in the **Foundation Hall** in **Dornogal**.

```
/way #2339 41.6 29.8 Dawn
```

During the quest line, you’ll travel to Siren Isle and assist an **Earthen named Bargus**. The adventure culminates in the exploration of the **Forgotten Vault**, where you’ll discover Cyrce’s Circlet on a skeleton wearing a pirate hat. Alongside the ring, you’ll also receive your first Citrine Gem.

Back on the surface of the island, you’ll complete the quest line by equipping Cyrce’s Circlet and socketing the Citrine Gem.

After completing the quest, you can purchase additional Cyrce’s Circlets from **Angorla**, located on Siren Isle, for **50 Flame-Blessed Iron** each. This allows players to acquire multiple rings for alternate gear sets.

## How to Upgrade Cyrce’s Circlet

Cyrce’s Circlet can be upgraded using **Raw Singing Citrine**, with each upgrade increasing the ring’s item level by 3.

Raw Singing Citrine is primarily earned through a series of timegated quests, with a new quest unlocking each week after the release of **Siren Isle**. These quests also grant unique bonuses that are active only while on Siren Isle when the ring is equipped:
